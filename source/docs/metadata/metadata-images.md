# Edit exif metadata in images

Photos, and images in general, contain metadata. For photos this includes how large the picture is, colour depth, 
resolution, the date and time when it was created, the GPS coordinates of the location they were taken at, camera 
shutter setting details, and possibly even the name of the program used to edit them.
