# Introduction

Operating systems and applications can always be reinstalled, but your data is unique, making it the most important thing on your computer or network to protect.

* Set permissions on the data files and folders.
* Some data is confidential; not only do you not want to lose it, you don't want others to even view it without authorisation.
  * Use removable storage for the most sensitive data (such as database and key files for password managers) 
  * Use file encryption
  * Use disk encryption
* Assume data loss is inevitable. It's not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. You best protect your data with a solid backup strategy.
  * Make a backup of your entire system or synchronise files with a remote system 
  * If you make a backup of a system for the first time to be able to restore a system from (the whole point of it), test it with an actual restore. Having done so helps in staying calm when the **** hits the fan.
* You may wish to shred and delete data and not have it found by anyone.
* Keep your authentication data in a password manager (on a local usb stick)
