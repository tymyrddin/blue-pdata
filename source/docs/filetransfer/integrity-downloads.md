# Checking integrity of downloads (Linux)

When downloading an ISO image of, for example, installing or upgrading packages or applications, or downloading 
software, you can verify the files have downloaded correctly and securely by using checksums. Checksums ensure the 
integrity of data portions for data transmission or storage. Checksums is a simple error-detection scheme in which 
each transmitted message is accompanied by a numerical value based on the number of set bits in the message. The 
receiving station then applies the same formula to the message and checks to make sure the accompanying numerical 
value is the same. If not, the receiver can assume that the message has been garbled (or was altered).
