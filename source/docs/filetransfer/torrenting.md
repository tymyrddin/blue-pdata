# Torrenting (P2P)

Torrents are file downloads from peer-to-peer networks: Video games, films, music, photos, and other forms of media. 
It works by allowing people to download small portions of data from distributed sources, and these portions are 
transmitted from one user to the next. The most common way to use torrents is through a special file that uses the 
`.torrent` file extension. Within the file are directions for how to share specific data with other people. These files
can be downloaded from a torrenting website.

Malware is one of the most prevalent threats you can encounter on torrenting websites. Anyone downloading a file 
from a torrenting website has no idea what the file contains. A film, or a malware. When you download 
and share a torrent file, the file’s creator becomes active and can track your online actions. If the file’s 
original uploader is an adversary, they can make use of this information.

* Run antivirus software on the file you download before opening it.
* Anonymise your traffic.
* Set up and use a sandbox (can do with a VM) for it.
