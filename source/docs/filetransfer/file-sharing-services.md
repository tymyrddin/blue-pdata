# Choose file sharing services

* [Onionshare](https://onionshare.org/) allows for sending big files via Tor. When sharing a file, the program 
creates a Tor Hidden Service — a temporary, anonymous website — hosted on your computer. Give the intended recipient 
of the file the `.onion` address for that site, and they can securely and anonymously download it through their Tor 
Browser. Avaialable for Linux. macOS, and Windows. An [Onionshare for iOS](https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare-ios) 
and [Onionshare for Android](https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare-android) are in development. The Onionshare for 
Android can already be found on the [Google Play Store OnionShare](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.onionshare.android)
* [Sparkleshare](https://www.sparkleshare.org/) was made to cover 
[certain use cases](https://github.com/hbons/SparkleShare/wiki). Designers at the GNOME Usability Hackfest in London 
came to the conclusion that they didn't have a good (Open Source) collaboration tool to share their work. It is not 
suited for full computer backups and large binary files that change often, like video editing projects.

* [Google Drive](https://transparencyreport.google.com/) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/transparency/reports) are probably not really private. The problem with their privacy policies and terms of service is not that they are malicious - they're there to help provide the service, but that they could be misused easily. There is no language that compels either to act in a user's interest. Alternatives that do use such language exist.
* [A yearly study by Comparitech](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/tech-giant-censorship/) looks at the number of content removal requests by platform, which countries have the highest rates of content removal per 100,000 internet users, and how things change on a year-by-year basis. The question Comparitech focuses on is "Which government censors the tech giants the most?"
