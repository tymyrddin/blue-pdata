# Introduction

Unauthorised access to our data can occur due to a web application not properly protecting data. A lack of quality encryption and improper key generation is often cause. Luckily, this type of vulnerability is relatively difficult to exploit when we have our machines locked down.
If you are running your own website or blog:

* Protect websites with the HTTPS (SSL/TLS) protocol
* [UnFloC your site](FloCed-sites.md)
* [Make your site GDPR compliant](gdpr.md)
* [Secure file uploads from users](secure-file-uploads.md)
