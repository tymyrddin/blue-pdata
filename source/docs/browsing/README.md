# Browser

## Threats (user perspective)

* Phishing (and therefore browsing) is one of the most low cost attack vectors in systematic attacks and data theft, with all of its consequences. Safer browsing is a good investment all around. 
* The way in which browsers are configured (especially the browser plugins used), together with details of the Operating System in which the browser runs, allows its users to be uniquely identified and tracked. 
* Third-party cookies are going extinct now that [many browsers block third-party cookies](Cookies.md), but that doesn’t mean Google (and others) will respect our privacy. Google started an experiment called [Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC)](FLoC.md). It runs in Google’s Chrome browser and tracks a user’s online behaviour.

## Mitigations

* [Use a secure browser that protect your privacy](alternatives.md)
* [Use private browsing](Private-browsing.md)
* [Use a VPN](vpn.md)
* [Minimise your browser plugins](Browser-plugins.md) to those protecting you (and even be careful with that)
* [Take control of your browser](Browser-configuration-editors.md)
* [Switch your user agent](User-agent-switchers.md) (also useful when doing reconnaissance).
