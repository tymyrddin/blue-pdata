# Private browsing

Privacy mode or "private browsing" or "incognito mode" is a privacy feature in some web browsers to disable browsing history and the web cache. This allows for browsing the internet without storing local data that could be retrieved at a later date, as in, **not saving** a history of the pages visited on the Internet. 

* Private browsing in Chrome is called Incognito. To open an Incognito window in Chrome, click Settings. From the drop-down menu, click New Incognito Window.
* For a Private Browsing window in Firefox, click Settings. From the drop-down menu, select New Private Window.
* Turn Private Browsing on or off on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch by opening Safari and tapping Settings, Private, and then Done.

When using "private" or "incognito" browsing, your real IP address and location are still being revealed to every w
ebsite, ad, and tracker that loads in your browser, and your traffic remains visible to your internet service provider 
(ISP). ISPs log everything and share the data with many other parties.

It is essential to also use a good [VPN](vpn.md) for basic digital privacy.
